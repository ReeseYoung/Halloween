<p>Scenario: You are heading to a farm for dusk photos with your friend/family. As you are being picked up by the owners of the barn, they let it slip that they had other intentions with you. You figure out that they are part of some kidnapping group and you are their latest find. They quickly blind fold you and you are dropped off at the entrance of a maze. They give you the night to escape the farm. If you follow all the rules could you be one of the few to escape the farm? Will you be caught before the night ends? Only time, your most precious friend, can tell.
